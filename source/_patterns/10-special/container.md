A container limits content to a maximum width

When To Use

A container is an element designed to contain page elements to a reasonable maximum width based on the size of a user's screen. This is useful to couple with other UI elements like grid or menu to restrict their width to a reasonable size for display.

Container Sizes

Containers are designed to responsively adjust their maximum width based on the size of the screen on which they are appearing.
